# Calories-Burnt-Prediction-Using-ML

In today's health-conscious society, individuals are increasingly adopting fitness routines to maintain a healthy lifestyle. One crucial aspect of fitness is understanding the number of calories burned during physical activities. Predicting the calories burned can aid individuals in optimizing their workout routines and achieving their fitness goals. Machine learning models can play a vital role in accurately estimating the calories burnt based on various personal and activity-related features.

Objective: The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the number of calories burned during physical activities. The model will utilize user-specific information and activity-related features to provide accurate calorie predictions.
